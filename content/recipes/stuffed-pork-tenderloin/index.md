yield: 4
prepTime: 45
cookTime: 30

ingredients:
- 450 g pork tenderloin
- 1 shallot
- ¼ semi-dried tomatoes in jar
- 5 g fresh sage
- 25 g Parmigiano Reggiano
- 125 g mozzarella
- 4 tbsp mild olive oil
- 50 g baby spinach
- 90 g prosciutto crudo
- 80 g AH Organic green pesto in jar

directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Allow the pork tenderloin to come to room temperature. Finely chop the shallot and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Pluck the leaves from the sage sprigs and finely chop. Grate the Parmesan cheese and mozzarella coarsely.

2. Heat ¼ of the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the shallot and sage for 3 minutes over medium heat. Add the tomatoes and spinach and let it wilt. Stir in all the cheese and set aside for later use.

3. Cut the center of the pork tenderloins lengthwise up to ⅔. Open them up and loosely wrap them in cling film. Flatten the meat with the bottom of a frying pan to a thickness of ½ cm.

4. Place 2 pieces of cling film (per 4 servings) on the work surface. Arrange the slices of prosciutto on them, so you get 2 rectangles slightly larger than the pork tenderloin. Place the flattened pork tenderloins on the prosciutto. Season the pork tenderloin with pepper.

5. Spread the meat with pesto and distribute the slightly cooled filling over it. Leave a 3 cm border at the top, so you don't push the filling out when rolling.

6. Roll up the meat as tightly as possible from the long side using the cling film. Remove the film, wrap pieces of kitchen twine around the meat, and tie them together.

7. Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan and fry the meat over medium heat on all sides. Transfer to an oven dish and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until medium-rare. Remove the twine and slice.

**Combination Tip:** Delicious with potatoes and vegetables.

**Preparation Tip:** You can also fry the pork tenderloin in the pan. Fry it for about 15-20 minutes over medium heat. Let it rest covered for another 5 minutes.
