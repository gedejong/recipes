yield: 8
prepTime: 40
cookTime: 40

ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized onions
- 1 clove garlic
- 150 g celery
- 100 g carrots
- 2 tbsp mild olive oil
- 125 g bacon strips
- 500 g half-and-half minced meat
- 70 g tomato puree
- 700 ml full-cream milk
- 690 g passata di pomodoro finely seasoned
- 50 g unsalted butter
- 60 g wheat flour
- 150 g Parmigiano Reggiano
- 250 g fresh lasagne all'uovo

directions:
- Chop the onion and finely chop the garlic. Cut the celery and carrot into ½ cm cubes. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the onion, garlic, vegetables and bacon strips for 5 min over low heat. Add the minced meat and fry over medium heat for 5 min until loose. Add the tomato puree and fry for 2 min. Add 200 ml milk (per 4 people) and let it boil down almost completely, while stirring over a high heat, this takes approx. 5 min.
- Add the passata and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 45 min with the lid halfway down.
- Meanwhile, make the béchamel sauce. To do so, melt the butter in a thick-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Mix in the flour and cook over low heat for 3 min. While stirring with a whisk, add the rest of the milk in parts. Do not add the next dash until the previous one is completely absorbed. Bring to the boil. Simmer the sauce over low heat for 2-3 min. Season with pepper and salt, if necessary.
- Preheat the oven to 180 °C. Grate the Parmesan cheese. Make layers in the oven dish of successively tomato sauce, lasagne sheets, tomato sauce, béchamel sauce and grated cheese. Repeat 3 times and finish with a layer of béchamel sauce and some grated cheese. Bake the lasagne for about 40 min in the middle of the oven.
