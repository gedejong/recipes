  - Ginger
  - Cookies
  - Easy
yield: 1 full cookie jar
prepTime: 30
cookTime: 40

ingredients:
- 170 grams of butter
- 200 grams of sugar
- 1 egg or a splash of milk
- 325 grams flour
- 1.5 ts backing soda
- quarter of a ts salt
- 1 tbs ginger powder
- 1.5 tbs freshly grated ginger
- 60 grams sugared ginger or 30 grams ginger syrup
- 2 tablespoons honey

directions:
- Chop candied ginger into small pieces. 
- Sift flour, ginger powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl. 
- Mix butter and sugar until slightly fluffy. 
- Add egg or milk and beat until completely blended. 
- Add half of flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix well. 
- Add fresh ginger, candied ginger and honey and stir these in as well. 
- Mix in the rest of the flour mixture to form a dough. 
- Divide the dough into walnut-sized balls or roll out the dough and cut out figures.
- Place them on baking paper on a baking sheet with generous space in between, because they are quite runny. For this recipe I used 3 baking trays. 
- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. 
- Bake the cookies for 10 minutes for soft ginger cookies and 12-14 minutes for crispy ginger cookies. If you only have 1 plate, slide the baking paper off your plate and let them cool on the baking paper. Store the ginger cookies in an airtight container.

I love making this recipe with our 2 year old daughter. It's easy,
quick and all the steps are delicious.
