cookTime: 15

ingredients:
- 300 g. of basmati rice
- 375 g. tofu natural
- 70 ml sunflower oil
- 800 g. wok vegetables (Japanese)
- 2 toes garlic
- 3 ts. soy sauce
- 2 ts. ginger syrup
- 1 ts. rice vinegar
- 4 ts. chili sauce
- 2 ts. water
- 1 ts. maizena
- 2 ts. seroendeng

directions:
- Prepare the rice according to the instructions on the package. Drain the tofu in a colander for 5 min. Put something heavy on it to squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Heat 50 ml oil (for 4 persons) in a frying pan. Pat the tofu dry and tear it with your hands into about 6 sloppy pieces of equal size. Fry the tofu over medium heat for approx. 10 min until golden brown and crispy. Scoop out of the pan and drain on kitchen paper.
- Heat the remaining oil in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry the vegetables for 4-6 min.
- Meanwhile, chop the garlic very finely. Bring the garlic, soy sauce, ginger syrup, rice vinegar, chili sauce and water to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 3 min. and stir in the cornstarch with a whisk until the sauce begins to bind. Spoon the fried tofu into the sauce, stir well and remove from the heat. Ladle the rice into deep plates or bowls, divide the vegetables over it and spoon the tofu with sauce on top. Sprinkle with the serundeng.
